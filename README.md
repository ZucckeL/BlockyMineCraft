Abstract — Minecraft, one of the masterpieces of the game
world, has been designed to improve people's visual memory,
thinking skills and design ability by stepping out of other game
patterns. This fiction has become a world where every age group
can have fun by removing people from their stress.
In the game, players will create their own cube designs. He
will try to survive by fighting other players. The areas to be
established by players in their own regions will be surrounded by
barriers and become a safer area. There will be various dangers
against the player and the final player will win.

Özetçe — Oyun dünyasının başyapıtlarından biri olan
Minecraft, diğer oyun kalıplarının dışına çıkarak insanların görsel
hafızasını, düşünme becerilerini ve tasarım kabiliyetini
geliştirmek üzere kurgulanmıştır. Bu kurgu, insanları
streslerinden uzaklaştırarak her yaş grubunun eğlenceli vakit
geçirebileceği bir dünya haline gelmiştir.
Oyunda, oyuncular kendi küp tasarımlarını oluşturacaktır.
Diğer oyuncularla mücadele ederek hayatta kalmaya çalışacaktır.
Oyuncuların kendi bölgelerinde kuracakları alanlar, bariyerlerle
çevrelenerek daha güvenli bir alan haline gelecektir. Oyuncunun
karşısına çeşitli tehlikeler çıkacak ve son oyuncu kaldığında
galibiyet elde edilecektir.

Introduction:

  Our project aims to help people to enjoy their daily stress
and improve their creativity. The game we have developed
is similar to Minecraft and can be played in multiplayer.
People can develop creative intelligence by designing
cubes, socialize when played as a multiplayer, or make new
designs with their friends to achieve their desire to win in a
competitive environment.

  This simulation will be prepared to be placed in a
player's actions, Unity3D environment can be followed up
to achieve the desired results. People will be given an
environment where they can develop their creativity and
have fun. In order to address the game tastes of people, the
first step will be to determine how much of a game is
designed in today's technology through evaluation studies.

System Design:

  The game consists of collecting multiple players around
2 main components. The first is the world and the second is
the character component. The world consists of cubes where
our character can change. The character is a combination of
the player's direction and the main camera(first person
Character). The interaction of these two components will
occur when the character changes the cube at some point on
Earth. It is designed with Unity3D libraries for the creation
of the world and this world consists of random. Each new
game will create a new world.Players will continue to fight
at the same time until the last player is left. 

  The project is implemented in Windows operating
system. This is because the Windows operating system is
the most common operating system today. The Unity3D
game engine has been implemented. There are two reasons
why Unity3D is used; the first is that the application is free,
and the second is that the libraries it provides to the user are
very useful and understandable. It also provides an easy
environment for multi-player systems to realize the serverclient relationship. So Unity3D is a good choice. C# is
selected as the programming language of the project.
Unity3D will be developed with C# language because it
offers a lot of resources for Game Development.

  When the player starts the game, he / she will see the
main menu in the first place.The main menu will select
single player or multiplayer as content. After the player
selection is made, if the game is played multiplayer, a server
must be created or connected to a server. After all players
are connected, for the new game, the game will be installed
and the game will start.

- Obtaining of Cubes and Barriers:

  The player will be able to go to NPCs and access Cube
models. NPCs distributed randomly across the globe will be
used. Players will also be able to obtain the cubes by
breaking the cubes in the world.

- The End Of The Game Design:

  In the game each player must have an area of barriers to
protect himself / herself. This area can be broken with a
variety of weapons that players can obtain, and each weapon
will have a certain durability. Players will be able to damage
each other with these weapons, and the game will be over
when their health points are done. The game will continue
until the last player remains.

Results and Discussion:

  This project is a competitive environment where people
enjoy and develop their creativity with great freedoms. The
biggest advantage of the developed system is that it enables
players to develop their creativity by applying the changes
they want on the world with the freedom they have provided
to create an unlimited world. It also allows different players
to socialize and have fun with the competitive environment
that is formed by interacting with each other. The most
important disadvantage is that people can lose a lot of time
as they can in all areas of the entertainment industry, as a
result, the project provides people with an entertainment
environment.

  System requirements are low because the graphics of the
game are not that extreme. But as the world grows,
performance can be negatively affected. Because the fields
that are created are stored in memory for reuse. If memory
is not sufficient, this can cause problems.
  Conclusion:
  As a conclusion, compared to similar projects, it was
seen that a single-player design was made by creating fixed
maps in most projects. It was also observed that they were
very simple in terms of content. In this project we tried to
prevent this simplicity by using various modules. This
provides multiple scenarios to the game. However, this
situation has caused performance losses and various
problems. For example, some problems have encountered
during the implementation of the multiplayer option. With
the correct design of the modules to be added(such as the
implementation of the multiplayer option from the
beginning), these problems can be avoided.

System Design

  The game consists of collecting multiple players around
2 main components. The first is the world and the second is
the character component. The world consists of cubes where
our character can change. The character is a combination of
the player's direction and the main camera(first person
Character). The interaction of these two components will
occur when the character changes the cube at some point on
Earth. It is designed with Unity3D libraries for the creation
of the world and this world consists of random. Each new
game will create a new world.Players will continue to fight
at the same time until the last player is left. 
The project is implemented in Windows operating
system. This is because the Windows operating system is
the most common operating system today. The Unity3D
game engine has been implemented. There are two reasons
why Unity3D is used; the first is that the application is free,
and the second is that the libraries it provides to the user are
very useful and understandable. It also provides an easy
environment for multi-player systems to realize the serverclient relationship. So Unity3D is a good choice. C# is
selected as the programming language of the project.
Unity3D will be developed with C# language because it
offers a lot of resources for Game Development.
When the player starts the game, he / she will see the
main menu in the first place.The main menu will select
single player or multiplayer as content. After the player
selection is made, if the game is played multiplayer, a server
must be created or connected to a server. After all players
are connected, for the new game, the game will be installed
and the game will start.
